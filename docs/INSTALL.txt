INSTALL
=======

1. Installation requirements
----------------------------

* Apache web server with mod_rewrite
* PHP 5.2.4 or higher (with mb_string module)
* Database (version 1.0 requires MySQL database)

2. Installation HOW-TO
---------------------

[i]  Unzip the installation package
[ii] Install the database
        - Connect to your MySQL database using this command: 
            mysql -u root -p (press enter and type your password)

        - Create the database with this command: 
            create database zfcol;

        - Create a database user and grant him access to your new database:
            grant all privileges on zfcol.* TO "user-name"@"localhost" identified by "user-password";
            flush privileges;
            exit;
            (change user-name, localhost and user-password according to your needs)
    
        - Locate the file "zfcol.sql" and create database tables with this command:
            mysql -u user-name -p zfcol < zfcol.sql
            (you will be prompted for your password)
    
        - Exit the MySQL command line tool
            exit;

        - Locate the file db.xml.orig in application/configs/ and copy (or rename) it to db.xml 
        - Edit the db.xml according to your setup

[iii] Setup your Apache virtual host
        - Locate yout apache configuration file (httpd.conf or apache2.conf)
          and create new virtual host for the ZF::Col installation

        <VirtualHost *:80>
            DocumentRoot "/path/to/zfcol/public"
            ServerName my-movies.example.org

            <Directory "/path/to/zfcol/public">
                Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
            </Directory>
        </VirtualHost>

    - Note that the DocumentRoot should point to the "public" directory
      of the unzipped directory structure
    - You do not need to create new virtualhost. An alias is also just fine, 
      but remember to:
        
         1. Include all options and overrides in the Apache "Directory" container.

            Alias /my-movies /path/to/zfcol/public/
      
                <Directory "/var/www/htdocs/my-movies/public/">
                    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
                    AllowOverride All
                    Order allow,deny
                    Allow from all
                </Directory>
         
         2. Modify the public/.htaccess file and add this to the first line:
                RewriteBase /my-movies

[iv]  Change permissions for the "zfcol" directory so that the
      webserver is allowed to write in it:

      chown -R apache:apache /path/to/zfcol
      (username may differ on your system)

[v]   Point your browser to your newly created virtualhost or alias, ie.

        http://my-movies.example.org
        or
        http://www.example.com/my-movies

      If everything went ok, you should see a login screen

[vi]  Log in with the these credentials:

        username: admin
        password: zfcol

      After the login, you will be redirected to the App settings page.
      Please adjust the settings, click Save and change the admin password
      by clicking on "John Doe" in the upper right corner.

[vii] Enjoy the app! For questions & bug reports, please visit project's website
